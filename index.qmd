  Selectivity is a fundamental component of age-structured stock assessment models,
  governing how fishing mortality and survey catchability vary with age or size. The
  choice of selectivity parameterization affects estimates of population abundance,
  fishing mortality, and management reference points. This manuscript compares several
  selectivity formulations---including standard logistic, double logistic,
  spline-based, and time-varying 2D autoregressive approaches---within a unified
  RTMB framework. We examine parameter
  identifiability, prior sensitivity, and the practical consequences of selectivity
  misspecification using simulation and application to eastern Bering Sea walleye
  pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*). Results highlight trade-offs between flexibility
  and estimability and provide guidance for practitioners choosing among selectivity
  options in operational assessments.

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Selectivity functions describe the relative vulnerability of fish to capture as a
function of age (or size) and are among the most influential---yet least
observable---components of stock assessment models. The assumed shape of the
selectivity curve directly affects estimates of spawning biomass, recruitment, and
fishing mortality, and misspecification can propagate into biased reference points
and management advice [@punt2013; @thompson1994].

Despite its importance, selectivity is often treated as a modelling convenience
rather than a biological or technological quantity to be estimated carefully. Most
operational assessments adopt a logistic or double-logistic functional form, chosen
for parsimony rather than fidelity to the underlying catch process. More flexible
alternatives---such as penalized splines or non-parametric approaches---can reduce
structural bias but may introduce identifiability problems, particularly when data
are sparse or conflicting.

This manuscript develops a comparative framework for evaluating selectivity options
within the R Template Model Builder (RTMB) environment. RTMB provides automatic
differentiation, Laplace approximation for random effects, and integration with
Bayesian sampling via SparseNUTS, making it a natural platform for exploring both
maximum likelihood and posterior-based inference on selectivity parameters.

We organize the comparison around four selectivity families:

1. **Standard logistic** (@sec-logistic): the two-parameter ascending logistic,
   widely used for fisheries where retention is assumed to be monotonically
   increasing with age.
2. **Double logistic** (@sec-double-logistic): a dome-shaped three-parameter
   formulation allowing selectivity to decline at older ages, motivated by gear
   avoidance, ontogenetic habitat shifts, or differential availability.
3. **Spline-based** (@sec-spline): a penalized B-spline approach offering flexible,
   data-driven selectivity shapes with smoothness controlled by a penalty parameter.
4. **Time-varying 2D AR1** (@sec-timevarying): a separable autoregressive structure
   over year and age dimensions, allowing selectivity to evolve smoothly through
   time while maintaining age-specific coherence via a Kronecker-structured
   precision matrix.

For each family, we present the mathematical formulation, an RTMB implementation
with prior specification, parameter sensitivity analysis, and MCMC-based posterior
evaluation. We then apply all to eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock data to
illustrate practical trade-offs.
